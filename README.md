# Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to store portfolio projects done during the Data Science unit (COMP257). 


## Prerequsites

Access to Jupyter Notebook version 6.0.0.


# Portfolio 1


## Analysis of Cylists' Performance & Statistics


### Description

This project includes the analysis of cyclists based on two data sets from two different sources: [Strava](https://www.strava.com) and [GoldenCheetah](https://www.goldencheetah.org). Datasets are merged and any unnecessary data are removed.

It displays histograms of different variables in order to indentify the distribution of these variables and attempts to find correlation between various variable using a correlation matrix and scatterplot matrix. Furthermore, different workout types are explored and findings are visualised. At the end of the notebook, a few challenging tasks are completed.


# Portfolio 2


## Energy Consumption of Appliances in Houses

### Description

Data used in this portfolio is been taken from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LuisM78/Appliances-energy-prediction-data). 

This notebook attempts to reproduce some of the work done previously that you can find in the repository(given above) and in the paper - Data driven prediction models of energy use of appliances in alow-energy house written by Luis M. Candanedo, VÃ©ronique Feldheim, Dominique Deramaix.

This portfolio work is about finding the best regression model for predicting appliances energy consumption in houses. The first part of the notebook includes the explorational analyis of data, then Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) technique is applied to examine the predictors. Furthermore, findings are compared with the results in the reference paper.


# Portfolio 3


## K Means Clustering Exercise

### Description

This exercise is about K Means clustering and its visualisation by interations. A set of random numbers are generated and K Means clustering algorith is applied to the data, then the clusters and their centroids are plotted by interations.
